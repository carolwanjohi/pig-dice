## Description

[This](https://carolwanjohi.github.io/pig-dice/) is a web application where 2 users can play Pig Dice against each other. The goal of the game is to be the first player to score 100 points.

On a turn, a player rolls a dice repeatedly until either:
* a 1 is rolled <br/>
  or <br/>
* the player chooses to hold(stop rolling)

When a 1 is rolled, the player's turn ends and no points are scored (the player gets 0 points).

If the player chooses to hold, all their points are added to his or her score.

The game ends when a player reaches a total of 100 or more points. This player becomes the winner.

## How Pig Dice Works

The program should display the inputted name of the two players when the Play button is clicked
- Input : 

       - Player 1 : John 
       
       - Player 2 : Jane
        
- Output : 

        - John 
        
        - Jane

Player 1 can roll the dice and their result is displayed as a score
- Input : Click Roll button
- Output : Score: 4

Player 1 can hold the dice and their current score is retained
- Input : Click Hold button
- Output : Score: 4

Player 2 can roll the dice and their result is displayed as a score
- Input : Click Roll button
- Output : Score: 6

Player 2 can hold the dice and their current score is retained
- Input : Click Hold button
- Output : Score: 6

If a player's roll is 1, their current score will revert to 0
- Input : Click Roll button
- Output :

        Roll : 1
        
        Score : 0

The program alerts the players of the winner
- Input : Score : 100
- Output : Player1 / Player2 is the winner
